==HOW TO SET UP NEBULAE INFINITUM IN SIZK AWESOME STEPS==

  # do a svn checkout into somewhere in your web server
  # create a database on phpmyadmin
  # import config/structure.sql into said database
  # open up [http://code.google.com/p/nebulae-infinitum/source/browse/trunk/config/config.php config.php] in your text editor and modify the following values:
    * BASE_URL; change this to whatever your url is (probably http://localhost)
    * MYSQL_DATABASE; change this to whatever your database is called
    * MYSQL_USER and MYSQL_PASS; change these to whatever they are (on xampp, they are "root" and "" by default)
  # open up the .htaccess file in your text editor and edit the absolute urls so that they match where the file would be found in your browser (e.g. "/nebulae/errors/404.php")
  # go to the users table in phpmyadmin and modify the veggieman user to be your own; the password hash can be generated by going to encrypt.php in your browser
