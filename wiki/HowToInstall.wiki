==How to set up Nebulae Infinitum==

  # Do a subversion checkout of the trunk into a folder on your server
  # Create a MySQL database (probably with phpmyadmin)
  # Import config/structure.sql into said database
  # Open up config/config.php in your text editor and modify the following values:
    * BASE_URL; change this to whatever your url is (probably http://localhost)
    * BASE_FOLDER; change this if you're not running at server root
    * MYSQL_DATABASE; change this to whatever your database is called
    * MYSQL_USER and MYSQL_PASS; change these to whatever they are (on xampp, they are "root" and "" by default)
  # Open up the .htaccess file in your text editor and edit the RewriteBase to be your subfolder if not running at root (no trailing slash)
  # Edit the users in MySQL to add your own admin user or edit the existing veggieman one; the password hash can be generated by going to BASE_URL/tools/encrypt

HELPFUL HINTS:
Make sure short_open_tag is on or else it will just spit out code on some pages until I change it.
