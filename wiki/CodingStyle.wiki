when working on nebulae infinitum's source, you should probably code in the same style as is approved here!! this will ensure that the code is easier to read, fo' sho'.

note: this style does not apply to the wiki!

note 2: a lot of old code does not follow these requirements! feel free to fix it as you come across it, but you don't need to just go through and fix _everything_, unless you like really want to. just don't break things!

 * use correct spelling and grammar in your comprehensive, explanatory commit summaries. refer to issues that you fixed, if applicable.
 * use double quotes for strings for passing into functions and values for variables; use single quotes for array indices.
   * exception: use single quotes for portions of html you will be echoing onto the page.
 * use long tags; `<?php` rather than `<?`
   * also substitute `<?php echo` for `<?=`

ok i dunno anything else so i guess i'll update this later
