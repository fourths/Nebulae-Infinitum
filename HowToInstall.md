## How to set up Nebulae Infinitum ##

  1. Do a subversion checkout of the trunk into a folder on your server
  1. Create a MySQL database (probably with phpmyadmin)
  1. Import config/structure.sql into said database
  1. Open up config/config.php in your text editor and modify the following values:
    * BASE\_URL; change this to whatever your url is (probably http://localhost)
    * BASE\_FOLDER; change this if you're not running at server root
    * MYSQL\_DATABASE; change this to whatever your database is called
    * MYSQL\_USER and MYSQL\_PASS; change these to whatever they are (on xampp, they are "root" and "" by default)
  1. Open up the .htaccess file in your text editor and edit the RewriteBase to be your subfolder if not running at root (no trailing slash)
  1. Edit the users in MySQL to add your own admin user or edit the existing veggieman one; the password hash can be generated by going to BASE\_URL/tools/encrypt

HELPFUL HINTS:
Make sure short\_open\_tag is on or else it will just spit out code on some pages until I change it.
